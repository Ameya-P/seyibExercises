# A List of Additional Readings

The hyperlinks will take you to their github link. Some of the PDF's are larger than github allows, which means that you will have to download them. You can download the PDF's by clicking the **RAW** button.

## Additional readings for conceptual topics covered in class.

Topics | Description
--------- | ----------
[Species Concepts](https://github.com/aazaff/paleobiologyWebsite/blob/master/AdditionalReading/Species%20Concepts.pdf) | A somewhat more modern view of delimiting species. I'm not a fan, personally.
[Mophometrics](https://github.com/aazaff/paleobiologyWebsite/blob/master/AdditionalReading/Morphometrics) | A fairly technical review of morphometircs from the perspective of anthropology.
[Phylogenetics](https://github.com/aazaff/paleobiologyWebsite/blob/master/AdditionalReading/Phylogenetics.pdf) | A  fairly technical review of different phylogenetic methods.
[Abiogenesis](https://github.com/aazaff/paleobiologyWebsite/blob/master/AdditionalReading/Abiogenesis.pdf) | A gentle read on different abiogenesis hypotheses.
[Genetic Neutral Theory](https://github.com/aazaff/paleobiologyWebsite/blob/master/AdditionalReading/Genetic%20Neutral%20Theory.pdf) | A good reivew of genetic neutral theory, but a bit bogged down in polemics.
[Ecological Niche](https://github.com/aazaff/paleobiologyWebsite/blob/master/AdditionalReading/Ecological%20Niche.pdf) | Currently the flagship ecological niche synthesis, but is perhaps becoming a bit out of date.
[Small-Scale Taphonomy](https://github.com/aazaff/paleobiologyWebsite/blob/master/AdditionalReading/Small%20Scale%20Taphonomy.pdf) | A classic review of various taphonomic concerns that paleontologists have to wrestle with.
[Time Averaging](https://github.com/aazaff/paleobiologyWebsite/blob/master/AdditionalReading/Time%20Averaging.pdf) | A more in depth review of the issue of time-averaging.
[Large-Scale Taphonomy](https://github.com/aazaff/paleobiologyWebsite/blob/master/AdditionalReading/Large%20Scale%20Taphonomy.pdf) | Another classic review of taphonomic concerns. There is some noticable overlap with the [Small-Scale Taphonomy](https://github.com/aazaff/paleobiologyWebsite/blob/master/AdditionalReading/Small%20Scale%20Taphonomy.pdf) review, but still a great read.

## Additional readings related to specific geologic events.

Topics | Description
--------- | ----------
[Cambrian Explosion](https://github.com/aazaff/paleobiologyWebsite/blob/master/AdditionalReading/Cambrian%20Explosion.pdf) | A fairly gentle read on the Cambrian Explosion. It is not as long as it first seems, as there are some extra pages at the end.
[Ordovician Radiation](https://github.com/aazaff/paleobiologyWebsite/blob/master/AdditionalReading/Ordovician%20Radiation.pdf) | Not exactly a true "review" paper in the traditional sense, but fairly short and easy to read.
[Late Ordovician](https://github.com/aazaff/paleobiologyWebsite/blob/master/AdditionalReading/Late%20Ordovician.pdf) | A classic review paper of the Late Ordovician extinction, but a tad out of date.
[Terrestrial Plant Evolution](https://github.com/aazaff/paleobiologyWebsite/blob/master/AdditionalReading/Terrestrial%20Plant%20Evolution.pdf) | A bit on the old side, but packed full of great information.
[Therapsid Evolution](https://github.com/aazaff/paleobiologyWebsite/blob/master/AdditionalReading/Therapsid%20Evolution.pdf) | The first student to email me the three main subgroups of Theriodontia gets one point of extra credit.
[End Permian](https://github.com/aazaff/paleobiologyWebsite/blob/master/AdditionalReading/End%20Permian.pdf) | A relatively short review of the end-Permian extinction. It is not very comprehensive, but is better than nothing.
[Foraminifera Revolution](https://github.com/aazaff/paleobiologyWebsite/blob/master/AdditionalReading/Planktic%20Foram%20Revolution.pdf) | Planktic Foraminfera are *really* important for ocean systems.
[End Cretaceous](https://github.com/aazaff/paleobiologyWebsite/blob/master/AdditionalReading/End%20Cretaceous.pdf) | Not the best review for a paleontology course, as it has a strong ocean geochemical slant.
[Late Eocene](https://github.com/aazaff/paleobiologyWebsite/blob/master/AdditionalReading/Late%20Eocene.pdf) | A smaller mass extinction that was not covered in class, but is interesting in its own right.
