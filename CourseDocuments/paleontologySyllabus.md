## COURSE PHILOSOPHY
	This course is organized around the idea of ontogeny. Ontogenesis is a concept in biology that describes the anatomical and behavioral development of an organism from its birth to its death. In other words, it means progression through the successive stages of life as you age â€“ e.g., birth, childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and death. 
	Paleobiology can be thought of as an extension of this idea, ontogeny, from individual organisms to species. Species are born into this world via abiogenesis or evolution from parent species; they grow in population size and geographic extent; and they eventually become extinct. If you understand the general processes governing the ontogenetic development of species and fossils, then you are equipped to hypothesize about the origins of any pattern you observe in the fossil record, whether or not you are familiar with the particulars of the place or time in question. 
	The course is split into two phases. In the first phase, we discuss the ontogeny of species and fossils in general terms. In the second phase, we proceed through successive periods in the history of complex animal life, and analyze the specific ontogenetic development of different evolutionary faunas. Evolutionary faunas are groups of species that evolved, dominated the globe, and became extinct around the same time. In other words, evolutionary faunas are the concept of ontogeny applied to groups of species.
