# R Exercises

This respository contains Fossil Exercises. Their purpost is to introduce you to the incredible diversity, ecology, and eovlutionary histories of fossil marine invertebrates. These are hands-on exercises and not meant to be completed on the computer. For that reason, the lab exercises are saved here as PDFs for printing. These exercises were initially designed Will Gearty for the Stanford University Evolution of Marie Ecosystems course. They have been modified for SEYI:Biodiversity by [Noel Heim](http://sedpaleo.org).
