# When the going gits rough

## Problem: this terminal thing is weird
Here is a great tutorial to introduce you to some basic commands - https://github.com/codeforamerica/howto/blob/master/Shell.md


## Problem: nothing happens, ever
If your prompt looks like this:

````
>
````

You probably entered a command that required a closing quote but was ommitted. To get out of
this situation, simply hit `CTRL-C`.


## Problem: git complains when I push
If you get a long paragraph of text every time you push, simply enter one of the two commands
git recommends to make the warning go away.


## Problem: Error that says this is not a valid git repository
Make sure you have navigated (`cd /path/to/your/repository`) to the correct folder


## Problem: I `git pull`ed and am stuck in this screen saying something about merging
Simply type `:wq` to be on your way.


## Problem: `git` cannot be found
You need to install git.


## Other problems
Copy and paste the error into Google and find the highest rated link to StackOverflow. While this won't directly solve
your problem, it will give you a good idea as to what is going wrong, and may even provide you with a solution.
