## Problem: this terminal thing is weird
Here is a great tutorial to introduce you to some basic commands - https://github.com/codeforamerica/howto/blob/master/Shell.md

## Problem: nothing happens, ever
If your prompt looks like this:

````
>
````

You probably entered a command that required a closing quote but was ommitted. To get out of
this situation, simply hit `CTRL-C`.


## Problem: git complains when I push
If you get a long paragraph of text every time you push, simply enter one of the two commands
git recommends to make the warning go away.


## Problem: Error that says this is not a valid git repository
Make sure you have navigated (`cd /path/to/your/repository`) to the correct folder


## Problem: I `git pull`ed and am stuck in this screen saying something about merging
Simply type `:wq` to be on your way.


## Problem: `git` cannot be found
You need to install git.


## Problem: I really don't understand why we are using `git`
`git` is a very popular piece of open source software for managing code versioning. It runs on any operating system, and is the defacto
standard for source control management. If you are working with code, or any plaintext document, it is a great way to manage
revisions to your code, backup your edits, and collaborate with others. Because it is free and open source, there are myriad tools
for working with `git`, and you do not have to worry about a company unilaterally discontinuing it.

Also, if you ever need to work with a software development team or programmers, it is extremely valuable to be able to be able to collaborate
with them in the environment in which they work. Not to mention it is a very marketable skill.
