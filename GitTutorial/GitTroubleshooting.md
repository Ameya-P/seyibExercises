# When the going gits rough

## Problem: nothing happens, ever
If your prompt looks like this:

````
>
````

You probably entered a command that required a closing quote but was ommitted. To get out of
this situation, simply hit `CTRL-C`.


## Problem: git complains when I push
If you get a long paragraph of text every time you push, simply enter one of the two commands
git recommends to make the warning go away.


## Problem: Error that says this is not a valid git repository
Make sure you have navigated (`cd /path/to/your/repository`) to the correct folder
