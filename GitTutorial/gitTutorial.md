# How to use git

A git repository exists both on **GitHub** (online) and on your **local** machine. It can also exist on machines other than yours (e.g., a project collaborator), but we will ignore that possiblity for the moment.

The key to successfully working with git is navigating the relationship between the **local copy** and the **GitHub** copy. This relationship is summarized by the concepts of ````pushing```` and ````pulling````.

## Pulling and Pushing

1. Pulling is when you take a file that you added or edited on GitHub and sync it with your local machine.
2. Pushing is when you take a file that you added or edited to your local machine and sync it with GitHub.

The primary issue then for you, as a git user, is whether you (1) want to add and edit files on the GitHub website, and only sync to your computer after the fact or (2) want to add and edit your computer and only sync (upload) your files to GitHub after the fact. I discuss the first scenario in the [Working from GitHub First](#working-from-github-first) section and the latter scenario in the [Working from your Computer First](#working-from-github-first) section.

## Working from GitHub First

Step 1: Navigate to your repository on the GitHub website.

Step 2: Create a new file

Step 3: Write your answers in the new file. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click the Commit changes button
