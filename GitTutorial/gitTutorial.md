# How to use git

What was hopefully made clear during the git installation tutorials - [gitWindows](https://github.com/aazaff/teachPaleobiology/blob/master/GitTutorial/gitWindows.md) or [gitApple](https://github.com/aazaff/teachPaleobiology/blob/master/GitTutorial/gitApple.md) - is that a git repository exists both on **GitHub** (online) and on your **local** machine.

The key to successfully working with git is navigating the relationship between the **local copy** and the **GitHub** copy. This relationship is summarized by the concepts of ````pushing```` and ````pulling````.

## Pulling and Pushing

Pulling is when you take a file that you added or edited on GitHub and sync it with your local machine.
