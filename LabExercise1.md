# Lab Exercise 1

## Instructions

Lab exercise 1 is broken into two components. The first part is an introduction to the Paleobiology Database Website. The second part is an introduction to the R computer language. The R tutorials and associated exercises are kept in a separate repository named [startLearn.R](https://github.com/aazaff/startLearn.R/blob/master/README.md).

You will likely be able to complete first part during the lab period, but will have to finish the second part of the lab as homework. Both components are due at the start of the next lab period: Wednesday January 27th. 

## Finding the Paleobiology Database Website

The URL for the Paleobiology Database is [www.paleobiodb.org](https://paleobiodb.org). However, because you are all honorary members of the development team, you can use the special development server at [www.training.paleobiodb.org](https://training.paleobiodb.org).  Go there now in your web browser. The first thing that you should see is the **SPLASH** page. 

<a href="url"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aazaff/paleobiologyWebsite/master/Lab1Figures/Figure1.png" align="center" height="450" width="500" ></a>

The Paleobiology Database (**PBDB** for short) splash page has a lot of information packed into it. At the bottom of the screen you will see some basic stats on the types and quantity of data located in the database.

Data Type | Definition
--------- | ----------
**References** | Scientific articles, books, monographs, or other sources of the data.
**Taxa** | A taxon (plural taxa) is a group of one or more populations of an organism or organisms seen by taxonomists to form a unit. 
**Opinions** | Different opinions on the correct taxonomic name/identification of different fossil taxa.
**Collections** | A group (collection) of fossil taxa at a specific location.
**Occurrences** | An individual observation of a taxon at a specific location.
**Scientists** | The number of scientists that are *officially* involved in the Paleobiology Database initiative.

## References

All data in the PBDB can ultimatley be traced back to one or more references. The interface for searching and viewing references is currently being overhauled this semester, which is why there is no search button on the splash page. You can still access the old references search feature by clicking [here](https://training.paleobiodb.org/cgi-bin/bridge.pl?a=displaySearchRefs&type=view).

The references search page should look something like this.

#### Problem Set 1

Let's take a look at a great scientific paper by Steven M. Holland and Mark E. Patzkowsky. Use the reference search tool to look up collections associated with their paper and answer the following questions.

<a href="url"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aazaff/paleobiologyWebsite/master/Lab1Figures/Figure3.png" align="center" height="450" width="500" ></a>

1. How many collections are associated with this references?
2. What is the reference id number for the article? 

Once you have answered the above questions, click the **view collections** hyperlink to see a print out of the collections associated with the study.

Click on collection no. **72438**.
