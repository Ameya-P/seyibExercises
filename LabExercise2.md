Fossil species are recognized and classified on the basis of morphology because other lines of evidence (such as interbreeding or genetics, used with living organisms) are not available. This can introduce subjectivity into the process of classification; all species display some range of morphological variability and the line between intra- and interspecific variability is often a judgment call. Further complications can be introduced by morphological changes during ontogeny (growth from juvenile to adult) and because of sexual dimorphism (different male and female morphology).
