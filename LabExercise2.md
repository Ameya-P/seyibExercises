# Lab Exercise 1

## Instructions

Lab Exercise 2 is composed of five big questions with several smaller parts. Write up your answers to all five questions in a separate word document and turn it in, **as a hard copy**, by the start of the next Lab on **February 3, 2016**.

## Question 1

Fossil species are recognized and classified on the basis of morphology. This introduces subjectivity into the process of classification because all species display some range of morphological variability and the line between intra- and interspecific variability is often a judgment call.

#### Step 1

Click [here](https://github.com/aazaff/paleobiologyWebsite/blob/master/Lab2Figures/Figure1.pdf) to see illustrations of 25 ammonoid specimens. Your job will be to group them into species, keeping in mind the potential for intraspecific variability, ontogenetic change, and sexual dimorphism.

#### Step 2
Open the [ammonite_classify.R]() file in R. It is a data file containing shell coiling measurements traditionally used in ammonoid classification, including diameter (D), the ratio of umbilical width U to diameter (U/D), and the ratio of shell width W to diameter (W/D). The file also contains the stratigraphic position of each specimen. Follow the instructions in the R file to classify the specimens and make graphs.

#### Exercise Questions 1

1. Your identifications (how many species do you recognize in the group, and which specimens belong to which species).

2. The morphological features you used to distinguish each species, including whatever combination of qualitative and quantitative traits you think are important.
 
3. The nature of ontogenetic change, if any, in the species

4. The possibility of sexual dimorphism as a cause of morphological differences and how you evaluated that possibility (the illustrations and data contain enough information for you to assess sexual dimorphism).

## Question 2

Examine the following cladogram and answer the questions.
