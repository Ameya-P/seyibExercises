# Lab Exercise 4

Modelling ecological niches using multivariate data analyses.

## Basic Concepts

Most data traditional data analyses are **univariate** or **bivariate**. A univariate analysis assesses a single variable, and a bivariate analysis compares two variables. For example, ````hist( )```` is a univariate analys, and a ````t.test( )```` or a scatter plot is bivariate.

Such analyses fall short when you want to analyze the relationships among many different variables - i.e., a **multivariate** dataset.
