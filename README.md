This material was originally developed by Dr. [Andrew Zaffos](http://www.azstrata.org) for *GEOSCIENCE 541: Paleobiology* at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The initial development of this publicly available content was funded by the University of Wisconsin - Madison and the [National Science Foundation](http://www.nsf.gov/) with the intention to leverage the [Paleobiology Database](www.paleobiodb.org) as part of the NSF Geoinformatics grant 0949416 (supplement) initiative for enhancing geoscience education.

Several of the lab materials used in this repository were modified from materials created by [Matt E. Clapham](http://people.ucsc.edu/~mclapham/) at the University of Santa Cruz.
