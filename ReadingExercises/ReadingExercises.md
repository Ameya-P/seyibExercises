# Reading Exercises

## Instructions

Usually, we will read and discuss a scientific paper or a chapter from Bonner 2006 twice per week. The goals are for you to learn how to read a scientific paper; to gain an understanding of the data and questions we're working with this summer; and to inspire your scientific creativity.

## Reading a paper

When you are reading a paper you want to do six things: Consider, Read, Elucidate the hypotheses, Analyze and interpret the data, Think of the next Study. This is referred to as the CREATE method. First, the key components of the method will be described; then suggestions for using CREATE in class activities and assignments will be provided.

1. Begin by reading the introduction to the article. You are shoul to **Consider** the relationships between the key concepts presented in the introduction. They often create a concept map of these ideas (i.e., a figure showing the relationship between the different ideas).

2. Next, move on to **Read** the methods and results sections, including all graphs and figures provided in those sections. In order to make sure that you understand what you are reading, you should (1) annotate and re-title figures to improve clarity; and (2) draw pictures of the methods (i.e., a cartoon) indicating how the study was actually conducted.

3. After you are clear on the methods used in the study, you need to **Elucidate the hypotheses** based on the results and write out the research questions above each figure or table.

4. With questions/hypotheses established, you then begin to **Analyze and interpret the data**. Please compare results between groups (i.e., experimental and control, other groupings of data analyzed) and draw conclusions based on the data. At this point, you should read the authorsâ€™ discussion and evaluate their conclusions.


5. Finally, you are should **Think of the next Study** (or experiment if it's that kind of study), think critically about the study and generate ideas about future research projects. This may include generating questions you would want to ask the author(s), or it may involve designing follow-up studies.
