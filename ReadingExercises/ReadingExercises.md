# Reading Exercises

Every week you must read each of the following papers or essays. You will then hand in a write-up on the article the following Monday. You will also have to be prepared to discuss the paper in class. If the quality of discussion is low, you may be called upon to read excerpts from your write-up to the class. An [example write-up]() is available on the course website.

## Warning!!!

I *may* substitute in different readings if the class decides it wants to explore other topics. I will always give forewarning before making a substitution, and this website will be updated. Nevertheless, you should not read too far ahead of the class schedule for this reason.
