## Instructions

The [following](#example-write-up) is an example write-up by Chris Maxwell. Your write-ups should follow the same general format, tone, and style. 

The [first section](#article-summary) should be an article summary, which covers the overarching question, the hypotheses tested, the data and methods used, and the ultimate conclusion of the paper. 

The [second section](#things-you-liked-about-the-paper) should illustrate elements that you liked about the paper. Vacuous statements praising the paper without examples or evidence (e.g., Chris's first line of the section) are discouraged. Praising specific analyses is encouraged (e.g., Chris's second paragraph). This paragraph is your opportunity to show off how closely you read and understood what was said.

The [third section](#things-you-did-not-like-about-the-paper) should illustrate elements that you did not like about the paper. Again, simply criticizing the paper is discouraged. You should offer *constructive* insights into how the paper or study could be *improved* - e.g., testing additional hypotheses, adding additional data. This paragraph is your opportunity to show off your critical thinking skills, and to fold in material you've learned elsewhere in the class.

The [fourth section](#evaluate-the-graphs-and-figures-if-any) should explain (1) what the figures were attempted to convey and (2) what you felt could be improved about them. If the paper does not have figures or tables, you can skip this section.

The total length of the document should be approximately one single-spaced page, Times New Roman font, size 12, and a margin width of 1-inch on all sides.

**[Abundance Not Linked to Survival across the End-Cretaceous Mass Extinction: Patterns in North American Bivalves
by Rowan Lockwood (2003)](https://github.com/aazaff/teachPaleobiology/blob/master/WritingExercises/Lockwood%202003.pdf)**

#### Article Summary

Lockwood investigates the relationship between abundance of taxa in the fossil record and survivability across the K/T mass extinction. The author first explains that ecological studies within live organisms have shown that abundant species are less likely to go extinct than rarer ones.  Lockwood then connects this idea to the fossil record by citing research showing that the abundance of the living community of benthic mollusks and the mollusks preserved in the fossil record are correlated.  Abundance information from the costal plain of North America was complied from published data.  Abundance was measured in three ways: raw, which was measured as the number of valves at a locality, rank, which ranks genera according to their rank of abundance in the assemblage, and proportional, which is the raw abundance relative to the total abundance of the preserved community.  Lockwood found that no correlation existed between the abundance of taxa and survivability in any of the abundance metrics across the K/T extinction and therefore concluded that the factors involved in mass extinction events are different from factors involved in background extinction.

#### Things you liked about the paper

The introduction of the paper is well written and concise.  Lockwood sets up the question to be solved with sufficient detail, yet does not bog the reader down with extra material. Lockwood simply states that there has not been much investigation about species abundance correlating with extinction within the fossil record.  The research question is developed clearly and its importance is backed up by previous literature. The methods of grouping data are explained well and seem to be eloquent ways of determining the relationship between abundance and extinction. The results are simple and definitive; Lockwood found that there is no correlation between the abundance of a species and whether it survived. 

The author then examined other explanations for the lack of correlation.  First, that sampling bias skewed the results due to rare taxa.  Second, that spatial or temporal differences would cause the true signal to be hidden.  Third, that some taxa are more likely preserved than others.  And fourth, the behavioral or physical factors of the organisms being counted.  These four concerns are all clearly addressed and refuted before the author concludes that a correlation does not exist.

#### Things you did not like about the paper

One question I have is why this research did not also investigate background extinction in mollusks.  The fact that species with low abundances have a higher chance of going extinct today, does not necessarily mean that abundance and extinction were generally correlated in the past. If we look elsewhere in the fossil record, during a period of background extinction, and see that abundance is indeed correlated with the xtinction, then those results would support Lockwood's conclusions.  On the other hand, if no correlation was found, even in a background interval, then either there is a problem with the fossil record or the present day is too unique. It is also a bit overly broad to conclude that mass extinctions are different from background intervals, as the end-Cretaceous is only one mass extinction. Other mass extinction might not be different from background intervals.

#### Evaluate the graphs and figures (if any)
The two graphs of this paper are easy to read and interpret.  The bar graphs with the large error bars show how similar the survivorship and extinction rate is in a very understandable manner.  I thought the chart was cluttered and difficult to read, however this information was explained successfully in the body of the paper.  Overall this paper was easy to follow and was concise while giving the reader the necessary detail and background information to understand the study.
